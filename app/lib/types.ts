// Design principle: the app forms its OWN opinion of a property's value, rent,
// and risk. So a `Listing` carries only facts you can actually observe from a
// listing page (price, size, condition, location) — never a handed-to-us
// "estimated value". Value and rent are computed by the valuation engine from
// `MarketStats`, which is the kind of market-level data you can get for free
// (e.g. Redfin Data Center publishes median $/sqft and YoY by metro/ZIP).
