// Outbound links from a listing back to the source website.

// A real adapter sets `Listing.url` to the actual listing page, and that is what
// we link to. Mock/demo listings have no such page, so rather than inventing a
// deep link that looks real and 404s, we fall back to an address *search* on
// Zillow and label it as a search — the link never claims to be something it
// isn't. Callers can branch on `isDirect` to word the affordance honestly.
